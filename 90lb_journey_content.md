**Expected Results**: 5-15 lbs loss (total 90+ lbs), stable weight maintenance, improved health markers, sustainable habits established
**Maintenance Protocol**: Core supplements only $60-100/month, electrolytes as needed (fasting days), weekly weigh-ins adjust if needed, monthly 24-hour fast, quarterly 3-5 day fast

## Nutrition Strategy

### The Math Behind 90 Pounds
- 1 lb fat = 3,500 calories
- 90 lbs = 315,000 calories
- Over 365 days = 863 cal/day deficit needed
- **Target: 750 cal/day (1.7 lbs/week)**

### Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (Most Accurate)
**For Men**: BMR = (10 × kg) + (6.25 × cm) - (5 × age) + 5
**For Women**: BMR = (10 × kg) + (6.25 × cm) - (5 × age) - 161

### Activity Factors
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly Active: 1.375
- Moderately Active: 1.55
- Very Active: 1.725

### Macronutrient Targets
**Protein: 30-35%**
- Muscle preservation, satiety, metabolic rate
- Min: 0.8g per lb body weight

**Carbohydrates: 40%**
- Exercise fuel, complex carbs only
- Include 25-35g fiber daily

**Fat: 25-30%**
- Hormonal health, healthy fats emphasized
- Include omega-3 sources

**Example**: 35M, 250 lbs, 5'10", Moderately Active
- BMR = 2,075 cal
- TDEE = 3,216 cal
- Target = 2,466 cal/day
